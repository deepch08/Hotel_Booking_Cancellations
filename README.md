Project Title: Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis Using Excel

This project analyzes hotel booking cancellations to identify patterns, trends, and key factors contributing to cancellations. Using Excel, I gathered and cleaned a dataset of hotel bookings, including information such as booking dates, customer demographics, room types, and cancellation reasons. Through pivot tables, conditional formatting, and data visualization, I explored cancellation rates across different variables, such as lead time, seasonality, and customer type. The project provides actionable insights that can help hotels optimize their booking strategies and improve customer retention.
